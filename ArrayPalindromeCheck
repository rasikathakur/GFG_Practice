//Given an array arr, the task is to find whether the arr is palindrome or not. If the arr is palindrome then return true else return false.

//An array is said to be palindrome if its reverse array matches the original array. 

class Solution {
    public static boolean isPerfect(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int revArr[] = new int[n];
        for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
            revArr[n-i-1] = arr[i];
            
        }
        
        return Arrays.equals(arr, revArr);
    }
}
//output:
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
Output: true
Explanation: Here we can see we have [1, 2, 3, 2, 1] if we reverse it we can find [1, 2, 3, 2, 1] which is the same as before. So, the answer is true.
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: false
Explanation: Here we can see we have [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] if we reverse it we find [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] which is the not same as before. So, the answer false.
