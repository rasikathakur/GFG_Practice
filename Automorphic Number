// Given a number N, check whether the number is Automorphic number or not.
// A number is called Automorphic number if and only if its square ends in  has the same last digit as the number itself.

class Solution {
    public String is_AutomorphicNumber(int n) {
        
        int lastDigitOfN = n;
        lastDigitOfN = lastDigitOfN%10;

        return "Not Automorphic";
        
    }
}

//output

Input: N = 76
Output: Automorphic
Explanation: 762 = 5776 which ends with 
6 which was also the last digt in original number therefore it is a automorphic number.
