// You are given a string s, consisting of lowercase alphabets. Your task is to remove consecutive duplicate characters from the string. 

class Solution {
    public String removeConsecutiveCharacter(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        sb.append(s.charAt(0));
        for(int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++){
            if(s.charAt(i-1) != s.charAt(i)){
                sb.append(s.charAt(i));
            }
        }
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
}

// Output:

Input: s = "aabb"
Output:  "ab" 
Explanation: 
The character 'a' at index 2 is the same as 'a' at index 1, so it is removed.
Similarly, the character 'b' at index 4 is the same as 'b' at index 3, so it is removed.
The final string is "ab".
