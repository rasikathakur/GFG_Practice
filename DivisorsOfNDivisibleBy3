// Given an integer n, find the number of divisors of n that are divisible by 3.

class Solution {
    static int countDivisors(int n) {
        // code here
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i ++){
            if((n%i) == 0){
                if((i%3) == 0){
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}


//output:

Input: n = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 6 are divisors of 6 out of which 3 and 6 are divisible by 3.
Input: n = 10
Output: 0
Explanation: 1, 2, 5 and 10 are divisors of 10 but none of them are divisible by 3.
