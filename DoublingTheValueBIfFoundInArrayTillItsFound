// Given an array and an integer B, traverse the array (from the beginning) and if the element in array is B, double B and continue traversal. Find the value of B after the complete traversal.

class Solution {
    long solve(int n, long A[], long b) {
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(A[i]==b){
                b = b*2;
            }
        }
        
        return b;
    }
}

// Output:

Input:
N = 5, B = 2
arr[] = {1 2 3 4 8}
Output: 16
Explanation: B is initially 2. We get 2 at
the 1st index, hence B becomes 4. 
Next, we get B at the 3rd index, hence B 
becomes 8. Next, we get B at 4-th index, 
hence B becomes 16.
