// Given an array of N positive integers where all numbers occur even number of times except one number which occurs odd number of times. Find the exceptional number.


class Solution {
    int getOddOccurrence(int[] arr, int n) {
        int result = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            result ^= arr[i]; //xor cancels out same occuring numbers in array and atlast the odd occurring number is stored
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}


//Output :

Input:
N = 7
Arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 3}
Output: 3
Explaination: 3 occurs three times.
