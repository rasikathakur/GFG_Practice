// Given a sentence containing several words and numbers. Find the largest number among them which does not contain 9. If no such number exists, return -1.

// Note: Numbers and words are separated by spaces only. It is guaranteed that there are no leading zeroes in the answer.

class Solution {
    long ExtractNumber(String sentence) {
        
        String splitWords[] = sentence.split(" ");
        long maxNum = -1;
        long num;
        
        for(String s : splitWords){
            if(s.matches("\\d+")){
                if(!s.contains("9")){
                    num = Long.parseLong(s);
                    if(num > maxNum){
                        maxNum=num;
                    }
                }
                
            }
        }
        
        return maxNum;
        
    }
}

//Output :

Input: sentence="This is alpha 5057 and 97"
Output: 5057
Explanation: 5057 is the only number that does not have a 9.
Input: sentence="Another input 9007"
Output: -1
Explanation: Since there is no number that does not contain a 9,output is -1.
