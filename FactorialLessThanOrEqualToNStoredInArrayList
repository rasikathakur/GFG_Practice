//A number n is called a factorial number if it is tStoredInArrayListhe factorial of a positive integer. For example, the first few factorial numbers are 1, 2, 6, 24, 120,
//Given a number n, the task is to return the list/vector of the factorial numbers smaller than or equal to n.

class Solution {
    static ArrayList<Long> factorialNumbers(long n) {
        ArrayList<Long> factList = new ArrayList<>();
        
        long fact = 1;
        int i = 1;
        while(fact <= n){
            factList.add(fact);
            i++;
            fact = fact * i;
            
        }
        
        return factList;
    }
}

//Output:

Input: n = 3
Output: 1 2
Explanation: The first factorial number is 1 which is less than equal to n. The second number is 2 which is less than equal to n,but the third factorial number is 6 which is greater than n. So we print only 1 and 2.
