//Given a number n, find the nth term in the series 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21â€¦

class Solution {
    static int findNthTerm(int n) {
        int num;
        num = n * (n + 1)/2;
        
        return num;
        
    }
};

//Output:

Input: n = 4 
Output: 10
Explanation: The 4th term of the Series is 10.
Input: n = 3 
Output: 6
Explanation: The 3rd term of the Series is 6.
