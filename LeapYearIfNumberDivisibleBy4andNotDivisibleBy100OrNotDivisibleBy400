// You are given an Integer n. Return true if It is a Leap Year otherwise return false.

class Solution {
    static boolean isLeap(int N) {
        if(((N % 100) != 0) && ((N % 4) == 0) || (N % 400 == 0)){
            return true;
        }else{
            return false;
        }
        
    }
}

// Output:

Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explanation: 4 is not divisible by 100 and is divisible by 4 so its a leap year
Input: n = 2021
Output: false
Explanation: 2021 is not divisible by 100 and is also not divisible by 4 so its not a leap year
