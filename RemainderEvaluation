// Given two positive integers n1 and n2, the task is to find the remainder when n1 is divided by n2.

class Solution {
    static int findRemainder(int n1, int n2) {
        int res = n1%n2;
        return res;
    }
}

//output:
Input: n1 = 5, n2 = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The remainder after dividing 5 by 3 is: 2.
Input: n1 = 5, n2 = 10
Output: 5
Explanation: 5 cannot be divided by 10 so it is the Remainder.
