// Given a number N. The task is to check whether it is sparse or not. A number is said to be a sparse number if no two or more consecutive bits are set in the binary representation.

class Solution {
    public static boolean isSparse(int n) {
         if((n & (n >> 1)) == 0){
             return true;
         }else{
             return false;
         }
    }
}

//Output
Input: N = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: Binary Representation of 2 is 10, 
which is not having consecutive set bits. 
So, it is sparse number.
Input: N = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: Binary Representation of 3 is 11, 
which is having consecutive set bits in it. 
So, it is not a sparse number.
