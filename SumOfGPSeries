//Given n, a and r as the number of terms, first term and common ratio respectively of an Geometric Progression Series. Find the sum of the series upto nth term.

class Solution {
    public long sum_of_gp(long n, long a, long r) {
        
        if(r == 1){
            return a * n;
        }else{
            return (long)(a * (Math.pow(r, n) - 1) / (r - 1));
        }        
    }
}


//Output:

Input: 3 3 2
Output: 21
Explanation: Series upto 3td term is
3 6 12, so sum will be 21.
