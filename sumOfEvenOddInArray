// Given an integer n, Return an array containing the sum of odd numbers and even numbers from 1 to n, where the first number is the sum of odd numbers and the second number is the sum of even numbers.

class Solution {
    public int[] findSum(int n) {
        int sumEvenOdd[] = new int[2];
        
        int oddCount = (n+1)/2;
        int evenCount = n/2;
        
        sumEvenOdd[0] = oddCount * oddCount;
        sumEvenOdd[1] = evenCount * (evenCount+1);
        
        return sumEvenOdd;
    }
}
//Time Complexity: O(1)
//output:
Input: n = 5
Output: 9 6
Explanation: Odd numbers upto 5 are 1, 3, 5 and their sum = 1 + 3 + 5 = 9.Even numbers upto 5 are 2 and 4 and their sum = 2 + 4 = 6.
